The jupyter notebook contains several blanks where you have to fill in your code to solve the problems. I kept all output that I obtained from running my solutions in the notebook and in the PDF, so that you can compare them to your results. For this purpose, you may find it useful to refer to the PDF rendering of the notebook because my program output will obviously disappear from this notebook as soon as you run your code.*\n",

    "In response to several questions in the lecture on Tuesday, and deviating from the foreshadowing on last week's problem set, we will defer the planned discussion of mutual information to the next problem set and use this problem set to practice Bayesian inference and the bits-back coding method.\n",
    "In this problem set, you will implement several compression methods that use a latent variable model, and you will compare the empirical compression performance across these methods by comparing the resulting bit rates for some sample messages.\n",
    "The methods that you will implement are:\n",
    "1. a naive method that simply ignores correlations between symbols in a message;\n",
    "2. encoding and transmitting a MAP estimated latent variable, then encoding the message conditioned on the MAP estimate; and\n",

    "\n",
    "We consider messages $\\mathbf x=(x_1,x_2,\\ldots,x_k)$ that are sequences of $k$ binary symbols, $x_i \\in\\{\\texttt{True}, \\texttt{False}\\}\\;\\forall i\\in\\{1,\\ldots,k\\}$.\n",

    "In this problem, you will encode the message $\\mathbf{x}=(x_1,x_2,\\ldots,x_k)$ with a more accurate model than the simplified model $P'$ from Problem 5.2.\n",
    "To do this, you will exploit the fact that the stochastic process that generated the message used the *same* value $z$ of the latent variable $Z$ for generating all symbols $x_i$ within any given message.\n",
    "Thus, the likelihood $P(\\mathbf X|Z=z)$ should be a better model than $P'$ for encoding the messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, the receiver doesn't know which $z$ was used to generate the message.\n",
    "Thus, you'll have to encode and transmit not only the message $\\mathbf x$ but also the value $z$ of the latent variable $Z$ (even though $z$ is not part of the message).\n",
    "\n",
    "While the *sender* might know the true value of $Z$ that was used during the generation of the message (depending on the circumstances of how our compression method gets deployed), knowing this value on the *sender* side doesn't actually help.\n",
    "All we want to achieve is to compress a given message $\\mathbf x$ into as short a bit string as possible.\n",
    "The fact that we have to transmit some value for $Z$ to do this is more of a nuissance, and nobody forces us to transmit the value of $Z$ that was actually used in the generative process.\n",
    "Therefore, instead of using the \"ground truth\" value of $Z$, we will use the value $z^*$ that minimizes the total resulting bit rate.\n",

    "- As discussed in the lecture, the solution $z^*$ is also called the *maximum a-posteriori* (MAP) solution since maximizing the joint distribution $P(\\mathbf X=\\mathbf x, Z)$ over all possible values of $Z$ is equivalent to maximizing the *posterior distribution*, $P(Z\\, |\\, \\mathbf{X}=\\mathbf{x}) = P(\\mathbf X=\\mathbf x, Z)\\,/\\, P(\\mathbf X=\\mathbf x)$ (because the posterior and the joint only differ by the positive multiplicative factor $P(\\mathbf X=\\mathbf x)$, which is a constant for any given message $\\mathbf x$).\n",

    "#### Your tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "You should be able to understand pretty much every aspect about the above plot.\n",
    "Explain the following observations:\n",
    "- Why do all methods become more effective (i.e., the bit rate per symbol drops) as the message length $k$ grows? (This is important to understand for the MAP and the bits-back method; for the \"independent\" method, it is just due to a small constant overhead of the coder, which becomes a bottleneck for very small $k$.)\n",
    "- How is it possible that \"compression\" with the MAP method (orange curve) actually *increases* the file size over the uncompressed representation (dotted gray line) for very low $k$? (Hint: think about the extreme case of $k=1$: what does the MAP method transmit in this case?)\n",
    "- Why does the compression performance of the MAP method (orange curve) approach the bits-back performance (green curve) in the limit $k\\to\\infty$?\n",
    "- In the limit $k\\to\\infty$, all curves seem to converge to two different constant values. What are these constants (express both of them as entropies of something under some probabilistic model)?\n",
    "  In particular, the fact that you were able to outperform the \"independent\" method—which would be the *optimal* compression method if the symbols were statistically independent (i.e., uncorrelated)—demonstrates that the symbols $X_i$ that our latent variable model produces really are correlated (I believe this was another source of confusion in the lecture).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** if you decrease the message length even further then you will get very noisy results because you'll then average over very little data (also, the coder has a small constant overhead of about 32 bits, which will become a bottleneck for very small $k$). Already in the above plot, the fact that the \"bits-back\" curve and the \"independent\" curve seem to meet at $k=10$ does not have any fundamental reason."

    "#### Solutions\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Why do all methods become more effective (i.e., the bit rate per symbol drops) as the message length $k$ grows? (This is important to understand for the MAP and the bits-back method; for the \"independent\" method, it is just due to a small constant overhead of the coder, which becomes a bottleneck for very small $k$.)*\n",
    "  - The MAP-method becomes more effective (per symbol) with growing $k$ because it's overhead (transmitting a value for $Z$) is bounded by a constant in our setup ($\\log_2(51)$, see below), and thus the overhead *per $k$* is bounded by $\\log_2(51)/k$, which goes to zero as $k\\to\\infty$.\n",
    "  - The reason why the bits-back method becomes more effective (per symbol) with growing $k$ is even more fundamental. We derived in the lecture that the net bit rate of bits-back coding is indeed the information content of the message $\\mathbf x$. Thus, the fact that bits-back coding becomes more effective (per symbol) with growing $k$ must mean that the (expected) information content per symbol decreases with growing $k$. This is indeed the case because the symbols $X_i$ are correlated (see also last question). Another way to look at this is: as you observe longer sequences of symbols, you can infer the value of $Z$ with increasing certainty. Therefore, your knowledge about the generative process grows, which means that you can model any subsequent symbols even better.\n",
    "- *How is it possible that \"compression\" with the MAP method (orange curve) actually *increases* the file size over the uncompressed representation (dotted gray line) for very low $k$? (Hint: think about the extreme case of $k=1$: what does the MAP method transmit in this case?)*\n",
    "  - The MAP method includes an encoding of some value $z^*$ for $Z$ in the encoded bit string. This value is additional information that is not part of the message. For example, in the extreme case of $k=1$, the MAP method encodes both $z^*$ (using the prior model $P(Z)$) and $x_1$ (using the likelihood model $P(X_1|Z=z^*)$). This is obviously worse than what the \"independent\" method would do in this extreme case. In our setup, the information content of $z^*$ alone is already $\\log_2(51) \\approx 5.67~\\text{bits}$, exceeding even the length of an uncompressed representation of the message.\n",
    "- *Why does the compression performance of the MAP method (orange curve) approach the bits-back performance (green curve) in the limit $k\\to\\infty$?*\n",
    "  - One way to answer this is by reference to the first question above: the (absolute) overhead of the MAP is bounded by a constant (the entropy of $Z$), and thus the overhead *per $k$* is bounded by $H_P[Z]/k$, which goes to zero as $k\\to\\infty$.\n",
    "  - However, it turns out that even the *absolute* overhead of the MAP method goes to zero as $k\\to\\infty$. This is because inference on $Z$ becomes more and more certain as the message length grows. In the limit $k\\to\\infty$, the posterior $P(Z|\\mathbf X=\\mathbf x)$ converges almost surely to a degenerate probability distribution with $P(Z=z^*\\,|\\,\\mathbf X=\\mathbf x)=1$ and $P(Z=z\\,|\\,\\mathbf X=\\mathbf x)=0$ for $z\\neq z^*$. Thus, the overhead of the MAP method becomes\n",

    "    R_\\text{MAP}(\\mathbf x) -(- \\log_2 P(\\mathbf X=\\mathbf x))\n",

    "  In particular, the fact that you were able to outperform the \"independent\" method—which would be the *optimal* compression method if the symbols were statistically independent (i.e., uncorrelated)—demonstrates that the symbols $X_i$ that our latent variable model produces really are correlated (I believe this was another source of confusion in the lecture).*\n",

    "    Thus, we'd actually expect the expected bit rate per symbol to be constant across the entire spectrum of $k$ for the \"independent\" method. The only reason why the line for the \"independent\" method is not flat is because of some small constant overhead of the underlying `AnsCoder` for very small $k$.\n",

    "**Note:** if you decrease the message length even further then you will get very noisy results because you'll then average over very little data (also, the coder has a small constant overhead of about 32 bits, which will become a bottleneck for very small $k$). Already in the above plot, the fact that the \"bits-back\" curve and the \"independent\" curve seem to meet at $k=10$ does not have any fundamental reason."
